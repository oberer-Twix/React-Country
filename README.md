# Getting Started

This is just a Test-Project for React
The Code is not clean and there is much to improve

# Data
The data is fetched from [Countries-API](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all)

# Start
To start the project, run the following command:
- ```npm install``` or short ```npm i```
- ```npm run dev```

# Positive
- Uses mostly standart JavaScript Syntax
- implement typescript is easy
- standart Hooks are easy to use

# Negative
- Styling only inline or in external file possible
- can appear "dirty" in komplex file
- no Structure-Pattern (hard to find the important lines)

# Usefull Libraries
- React-Bootrtrap / Tailwind `styling`
- Redux `function provider`
- Next.js `SSR`
